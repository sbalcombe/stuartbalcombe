Earlier this week I shared how I was changing the direction of my web app challenge. After several more positive conversations with potential users, I felt confident I'd found a problem that needed to be solved. The next step was to make a working prototype.

‍

I created a screencast that shows exactly how I built a functional MVP to test my idea without code in less than 30 minutes.

‍

**The result?** I now get automated insights into my self-employment tax liability every time I receive a new payment.

‍

If the video doesn't load correctly. [Try this link](https://soapbox.wistia.com/videos/jvwgETFubd).

‍

In the video case study I cover:

*   The challenge of calculating your self-employed tax liability.
*   My process for thinging through an automated solution.
*   Creating a working prototype using Zapier and Google Sheets.

‍

My next step is to turn this proof of concept into a marketable product with a landing page and downloadable set of resources.

‍

Check out the video and let me know what you think. If you’d like to set up similar automation yourself, drop me an email at [stuartbalcombe@gmail.com](mailto:stuartbalcombe@gmail.com) and I'll send you all the resources I used in my prototype.
