*This is an update from Week 5 of my web app challenge. I challenged myself to build a software product and generate $1000 in real revenue in 3 months.*

Earlier this week I shared how I was [changing the direction](/a/solving-the-right-problems) of my web app challenge. After several more positive conversations with potential users, I felt confident I'd found a problem that needed to be solved. The next step was to make a working prototype.

I created a screencast that shows exactly how I built a functional MVP to test my idea without code in less than 30 minutes.

**The result?** I now get automated insights into my self-employment tax liability every time I receive a new payment.

If the video doesn't load correctly. [Try this link](https://soapbox.wistia.com/videos/jvwgETFubd).

In the video case study I cover:

- The challenge of calculating your self-employed tax liability.

- My process for thinging through an automated solution.

- Creating a working prototype using Zapier and Google Sheets.

My next step is to turn this proof of concept into a marketable product with a landing page and downloadable set of resources. 

Check out the video and let me know what you think. If youâ€™d like to set up similar automation yourself, drop me an email at [stuartbalcombe@gmail.com](mailto:stuartbalcombe@gmail.com) and I'll send you all the resources I used in my prototype.
