			<h2>Stuart Balcombe: Monthly Growth Support Agreement</h2>
			<p>This is a Growth Retainer Agreement between Stuart Balcombe. (“we,” “us,” “our”) and any individual, entity, or organization that procures our “Growth Retainer” services (“you” or “your”). If you have any questions about this agreement, you can email Stuart Balcombe.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p><strong>Acceptance of Terms:</strong> Any work that I do for you is governed by the terms and conditions that you’re reading now. If you don’t agree to these terms, we can’t provide you with any services. This agreement is a binding contract between you and Stuart Balcombe.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Terms May Change:</strong> You should know that, periodically, we may change the terms and conditions in this document, including the amount of our fees. If we do change them, the new terms and/or pricing will become effective for you on the next date on which your services with Stuart Balcombe are scheduled to renew. We’ll always give you at least thirty days to review these changes before new pricing and terms take effect.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Payment:</strong> Our fee structure is simple. After charging you for your initial report and first month, we charge you one month at a time, due on the one-month anniversary date of us beginning our engagement.</p> <p>We’ll need a valid ACH account (checking or savings) from you, which we’ll keep on file with our merchant service provider to bill your account automatically. We use industry-standard third-party vendors to manage our payment system and your information. You agree to keep your billing information current and agree that you’re solely responsible for failing to do so.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Taxes:</strong> You’re responsible for payment of all applicable sales and use taxes.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Refund:</strong> You’re welcome to a full refund of what you’ve paid to us in the first thirty days of our service. To take advantage of this refund, you need to terminate our services and ask us in writing (an email to stuartbalcombe@gmail.com will do fine) for a refund within thirty days of the commencement of this agreement. <br /> No refund is available before or after that time period.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Services:</strong> Under all offerings, we’ll provide the following services: heat tracking maps, which show where people are generally clicking most often on your website; click maps, which allow you to hover over different elements of a web page and receive data about how many people are clicking on that portion of the page, as well as what percentage of total visitors are doing; an A/B Test, meaning a live test of small changes to your website to determine their efficacy in achieving your goals; and a monthly PDF report that summarizes the effects of our testing on your stated goals (such as user sign ups, clicks-to-purchase, etc.). Generally speaking, we’ll provide these services and deliverables on a 30-day timetable (though not necessarily starting on the first of the month).</p></li>
