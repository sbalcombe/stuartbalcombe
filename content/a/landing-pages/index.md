Have you ever been to the website of a hot new startup, started reading and found yourself wondering “What does this company actually do?”

Unfortunately, this is all too common and leads to frustrated visitors and poor results for your business. You spend a lot of time, effort and probably money getting people to your website so why not take the time to roll out the red carpet when people arrive?

If you can address the specific questions your visitors have and explain how your product will relieve them from their current help them achieve their goals you’ll greatly increase the chances they’ll engage with your content, subscribe to your emails and ultimately buy your product or service.

So how do you we ensure our page does just that? Here are the 5 steps I use to build landing pages that convert visitors into customers.

### 1. Start with your customer

Before you write any copy, design any pages and certainly before opening your code editor, **get to know your customers**.

> People are not searching the internet for your product, but for solutions to their problems.
>
> People don’t care about you, they care about themselves.
>
> You need to sell people a better version of themselves.

To do this effectively, you can’t write for everyone.

#### Stages of awareness
When you know your prospect’s stage of awareness, you know what type of story will resonate most with them. Back in 1966, Eugene Schwartz identified 5 stages of awareness that we can use to dial in our message.

1. The Most Aware: Your prospect knows your product, and only needs to know “the deal.”
2. Product-Aware: Your prospect knows what you sell, but isn’t sure it’s right for him.
3. Solution-Aware: Your prospect knows the result he wants, but not that your product provides it.
4. Problem-Aware: Your prospect senses he has a problem but doesn’t know there’s a solution.
5. Completely Unaware: No knowledge of anything except, perhaps, his own identity or opinion.

It’s much easier to sell to someone who is already aware of their problem and frustrated by it than someone who requires education about the problem itself as they are yet to experience the pain.

Understanding your desired target customer’s specific pains and frustrations will not only ensure your landing page resonates with them but can also give you a head start on writing great copy for your landing page.

By identifying the way our customers talk about their current challenges we can engage them in the language they already use to describe their goals and current barriers to achieving them.

The best way to do that is to find your prospective customers they hang out and observe their conversations. Here are 4 common places to find conversations to observe without leaving your office. 

- Reddit: With more than 250 million users conveniently segmented by subreddit Reddit is a good place to learn how your target customers talk about their challenges.

- Online Communities (Slack, Facebook, LinkedIn): A quick Google, or Facebook search for: “your target audience” + “community” will give you a good starting point.

- Twitter: Try searching for mentions of products aimed at your target audience or mentions of the problem your product solves.

- Sales Calls: You and your team may already be having conversations with your target customers. This is a great opportunity to dig deeper into their thinking.

As you’re observing your target audience in their natural habitat, try to identify the specific frustrations they’re complaining about and what is motivating them to resolve them. 

Create a swipe file of “language” to utilize in your landing page by copying quotes into a document and grouping them under 2 headings. 

| Problems       | Dreams        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned |
| col 2 is      | centered      |

Finally, pick 2-3 real people who’s problems and dreams you wrote about in your swipe file and start a direct conversation with them preferably over the phone, but chat or email works too. Your goal is to identify, of all the pain points they mentioned, what is the most burning, what is the pain that if an effective solution is presented will make them say: “shut up and take my money”.
