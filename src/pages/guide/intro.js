        <SubHead>Why I'm writing this guide</SubHead>
        <BodyText>I started my career as a "growth hacker". In 2016, though, one night changed the entire way I viewed my career. At the Intercom World Tour, then-Director of Growth Ben McRedmond shared his concern with the popular <StyledLink href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/how-do-you-define-a-growth-team/" target="_blank">definition of growth</StyledLink>. To him, growth should be a function of helping customers make progress in their lives. I still think about that line, even years later.</BodyText>
        <BodyText>The most powerful way to think about building products is to make sure that above all else, people are successful using what you built. Solve for the customer, not your product. In reality, though, great products don't come down to one feature or customer action. You need a holistic experience that solves for your users to be successful in 2019 and beyond.</BodyText>
        <BodyText>Over the past four years, I've led both growth and product teams at scaling startups. Along the way, I've spent thousands of hours designing and building product experiences at many <StyledIntLink to="/about">B2B SaaS companies</StyledIntLink>. My goal here is to distill that experience into one guide to help SaaS companies achieve product/market fit, increase usage, and grow revenue.</BodyText>
